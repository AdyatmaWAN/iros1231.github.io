I am interested in control and reinforcement learning for making robots progressively more autonomous. I also like teaching as a way to participate in building the future today.

See my [research](https://tttor.github.io/research.html), [teaching](https://tttor.github.io/teach.html), and other [stuff](https://tttor.github.io/others.html).
